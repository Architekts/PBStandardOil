American.4.t:0 "Union Standard Oil Internal Audit Report, 1933"
American.4.d:0 "Our situation here is pretty comfortable for the most part. Boomtown sits on a very abundant deposit of crude oil, and our developments in refinement techniques have improved drastically over the years.\n\nThe immediate problem Standard Oil is facing is in regards to the sparse workforce. In retaliation to our secession, former employees were forbidden to return by the order of the Santa Fe government. This normally wouldn’t be a problem for a large corporation, but being in the Wild West comes with the added problem of being removed from the dense population centers you would normally find in the east. We will have to be creative to fill these openings.\n\nAdditionally, we are somewhat inexperienced in the nature of governance, we're businessmen not politicians. For now, we leave the very small frontier communities to their own devices, but this way of governance isn’t going to last long term if we plan on making a difference out here."
American.4.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

American.3.t:0 "Unexpected Visitors"
American.3.d:0 "One morning, Conrad was sitting at his desk looking over some surveys of potential expansions, when a knock on his office door rang out. ‘Mr. Rockefeller, sir?’ his female secretary calls out. ‘You have a visit from some family.’\n\nA bit perplexed, he lowers the documents and calls for them to come in, not expecting a visit from anyone. To his surprise, in struts John D. Rockefeller III, direct heir of Standard Oil proper and son of the current proprietor, John Rockefeller II. He’s wearing some very nice clothing; the kind of fabrics you won't find out here in the plains, which means he must’ve just arrived from the Dominion.\n\n‘Ah. There you are, Conrad!’ he exclaims with a smug grin on his face, as he removes his leather gloves. “Quite the..’enterprise’ you’ve thrown together here, old boy. Nothing compared to what we got back home, but it's an admirable attempt nonetheless.”\n\n‘What do you want, John?’ Conrad asks. He never particularly liked him, and he only met him once when they were boys and another at a gala.\n\n‘I came to settle some business,’ John starts, and casually sits down in a chair, with his henchmen lingering behind him. He holds out his cigar for his henchmen to light. ‘You owe a debt, I’m afraid. You’ve used the Standard Oil name without consulting us, and now that you’ve participated in this whole charade out here in Timbuktu, it’s complicated things out east. I’d elaborate further but I don’t think you’d comprehend it.’ he says before he takes a puff. \n\n‘You have two options, I’m afraid.’ he says, blowing his cigar smoke in the air. ‘One, you can forfeit your little fief out here,” he says with a scoff. ‘Or two, we can come to an agreement. You can continue to use the name so long as we receive the proper compensation for your infringement.’"
American.3.a:0 "You’ll get your money.."
American.3.b:0 "Conrad disagrees, and John won't take no for an answer"
American.3.c:0 "Conrad eye twitches as he pulls out a revolver and shoots John in the head"

American.5.t:0 "1933 Market Analysis"
American.5.d:0 "As it stands, our main competition originates from Texaco in Dallas and Petro-Amiga in California, as they are the largest producers of crude oil in the region by far. They sit on a sea of black gold, and it will be a herculean task to overtake their supremacy within the market\n\nIn regards to our place within the North America market, Union Standard Oil is near the bottom of the totem pole. We turn a good profit based on the Boomtown derricks and refinery services we offer to other gas companies, but nothing that can influence the global stage. We are not like the main branch, Standard Oil proper (who is based within the Dominion), and are very limited on our variety of locations.\n\nSomething else that concerns external financiers is our dependence on crude oil as our main export. Being coined as a ‘Petrostate’, we are open to the falling victim to the Dutch Disease, the conditions where our dependence on one commodity can lead to a total economic collapse if the oil trade was to have a recession. Diversification is the solution, but out here in the middle of nowhere it's hard to find something that’s valuable to trade...\n\nWe will have to get creative to sort this out."
American.5.a:0 "Can't afford put all our eggs in one basket"
